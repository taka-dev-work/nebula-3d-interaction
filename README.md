  <h1>Nebula Hand Control</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Nebula Hand Control is a cinematic, real-time 3D particle system that runs directly in your web browser. It utilizes your webcam and computer vision to track hand gestures, allowing you to control a cloud of 15,000 particles without touching the screen. Users can rotate the 3D scene by moving their hand, swipe to morph the particles into different shapes (Sphere, Heart, Saturn, Flower, Fireworks), and interact physically by pinching to attract or repel particles. The experience is accompanied by a generative audio engine that reacts dynamically to your gestures.
